<h4>Hey! I know you'll think this is just a single page, what type of nerd I'm. <br /> 
<h4>No wait! Let me give you a task, find the nav bar. It exists on the page itslelf! All the required pages exist but you need to find out. <br />
Hint : it's not on the top try scrolling over the contents maybe :) (that's the answer lol)</h4>
